Backstory
Blooms & Co is a rapidly growing floral e-commerce startup that allows customers to upload images of flowers they‚Äôd like to purchase. However, manually identifying thousands of flower images every day became overwhelming for their support team, leading to slow response times and inconsistent identifications. Blooms & Co needed an automated, reliable way to classify different flower species so they could streamline the ordering process and improve customer satisfaction.

Solution
This Flower Classifier Project demonstrates how a convolutional neural network (CNN) can solve Blooms & Co‚Äôs identification challenge. By training on a dataset of labeled flower images, the model can accurately categorize each image into specific species (e.g., daisies, roses, sunflowers). This reduces manual overhead, speeds up the workflow, and ensures a more consistent user experience. While this repository uses a sample dataset and structure, the approach can be adapted to real-world environments, helping any organization that relies on quick, accurate flower identification.
